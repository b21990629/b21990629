I am Hasim. I like doing and watching sport. I am FENERBAHCE fan. I am twenty years old. I am studying at Hacettepe University Computer Enginering department.
I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will now expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
